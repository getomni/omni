## New theme idea?

We would love to support all applications out there, but we need your help to accomplish that. 

Feel free to create a new theme based on our [color palette](https://github.com/getomni/omni#color-palette).

## Add a new theme to the organization?

If you have already created an theme, make sure you check the following requirements:

- [] The theme follows the [template](https://github.com/getomni/template).
- [] The theme follows the Omni Color Palette.
- [] The branch name is `main` (we will keep this name pattern from now on)
- [] The theme has instructions on how to install it.

- **Application:** Ex. Windows Terminal
- **GitHub URL:** Ex. https://github.com/getomni/omni

## Existing Theme?

Find the appropriate repository on the [Omni organization](https://github.com/getomni). 
This repository is an umbrella place where we list all themes.
