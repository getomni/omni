# Contributing

First off, we would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute and make this a better project!

Here we have a set of instructions and guidelines to reduce misunderstandings and make the process of contributing to Omni as smooth as possible. We hope this guide makes the contribution process clear and answers any questions you may have.

## Language

While contributing or interacting in this project, please refrain from using any language other than English.

### For native English speakers

Try to use simple words and sentences. Don't make fun of non-native English speakers if you find something wrong with how they express themselves.

Try to encourage newcomers to express their opinions and make them comfortable enough to do so.

## Creating new themes

To submit a new theme, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository based on the [template](https://github.com/getomni/template).
2. Build the new theme using the [Omni Color Palette](https://github.com/getomni/omni#color-palette).
3. Submit an issue with the link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Omni organization.
4. Open a PR to add the theme to the main repository (this one). Add it under its respective category (if it doesn't exist, you can create one). Also, make sure it is in alphabetical order.
5. Finally, after your theme is under the organization, spread the word by tweeting about it and encouraging others to try it out.
